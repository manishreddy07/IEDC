Came up with a solution called “Intelligent Proctor” which autonomously monitors the candidates  throughout the exam duration, replacing human proctor and detects any instances of mal-practices such as the student looking away from the screen, the student using a mobile phone or any other gadget, appearance of any other person other than the student in the room, any other person helping the student by telling him the answers without appearing in the web cam etc. Which would make malpractice in exams very difficult as we have overcame most of the ways in which the student could cheat in their examinations all this without the need of an actual human proctor for monitoring every student separately throughout the exam. This in turn would help a lot and be very cost efficient for the organizations as they wouldn’t need to hire proctors to monitor every student.
